tagline: Error Handling in JavaScript
preview: Error handling is an essential aspect of JavaScript programming. It allows developers to anticipate and handle errors that may occur during the execution of their code. By implementing proper error handling techniques, developers can ensure that their applications are robust and resilient. In JavaScript, error handling can be done using try-catch blocks, where potential errors are enclosed within the try block and handled in the catch block. Additionally, JavaScript provides various built-in error objects, such as Error, SyntaxError, TypeError, etc., which can be used to identify and handle specific types of errors. Proper error handling not only helps in debugging and troubleshooting but also enhances the overall user experience by providing meaningful error messages.
